# didcomm-gemini

"Gemini 1" is the name of a project to get DIDComm v2 mature enough to adopt. The Gemini 1 project is sponsored by SICPA, but the code and artifacts it produces carry an Apache 2 license. Gemini does not replace the important work that is being done in DIF's DIDComm working group (where the DIDComm v2 spec is being incubated); rather, it supplements it by coordinating work on libraries that are implementing the spec on an aggressive timeline.

This repo doesn't hold code. It exists mainly for coordination purposes. Individual repos will be created for work on DIDComm libraries in various programming languages -- but overall issue tracking and design work that is not language- or artifact-specific will live here.

The main tools we'll use here are issues, the project definition (where we can see a kanban board), and the wiki.
