# didcomm-gemini

This repo exists mainly for coordination purposes. Individual repos will be created for work on DIDComm libraries in various programming languages -- but overall issue tracking and design work that is not language- or artifact-specific will live here.

The main tools we'll use here are issues, the project definition (where we can see a kanban board), and the wiki.

For real-time communication, please join us on slack:
